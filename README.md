# Air_Quality_Prediction_Model

This project is about using machine learning techniques, specifically time series forecasting, to predict the air quality index in Indian cities. The goal is to leverage historical data and various factors that affect air quality to forecast future air quality trends. By analyzing and understanding these trends, it can contribute to monitoring and improving air quality, which is crucial for public well-being.

**Here's a more detailed summary and description of the project:**

The increasing levels of air pollution in Indian cities have become a significant concern for public health and the environment. To address this issue, this project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the air quality index (AQI) based on historical data and various factors that influence air quality.

The project involves collecting and analyzing a dataset containing information about air pollutants, meteorological conditions, and other relevant variables that impact air quality. This data is then preprocessed and prepared for use in machine learning algorithms.

The core of the project is the application of time series forecasting techniques, specifically the Prophet library developed by Facebook. Prophet is a powerful tool for modeling and forecasting time series data, taking into account seasonal patterns, trends, and other time-varying components.

By training the Prophet model on the historical air quality data, the project aims to develop a reliable forecasting system that can predict future AQI values. These predictions can then be used to identify potential air quality issues and take proactive measures to mitigate them.

The project not only focuses on the technical aspects of data analysis and machine learning but also highlights the importance of monitoring and understanding air quality for public well-being. By providing insights into future air quality trends, this project can help raise awareness and inform decision-makers, policymakers, and the general public about the need for sustainable practices and effective air pollution control measures.

Overall, this project combines the power of machine learning algorithms, specifically time series forecasting techniques, with the crucial goal of improving air quality in Indian cities. By leveraging data-driven approaches, it aims to contribute to a healthier living environment and promote sustainable practices for a better future.
